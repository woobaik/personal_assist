# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# puts "******I'm going to start save date from city_list to database ********"

# city_list = JSON.parse(File.read('city_list.json'))
# city_list.each do |city| 
#     City.create(city_id: city['id'], name: city['name'], country: city['country'])
# end
